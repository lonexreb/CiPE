# Identify the Problem:

## Medication Management: 
Patients struggle with keeping track of their medications, leading to potential health risks.
Side-Effects and Drug Interactions: Patients face the risk of adverse side effects and harmful drug interactions from prescribed and supplementary medications taken together without realizing the potential dangers.

## Lack of Personalized Monitoring: 
There's a need for a personalized tool that can monitor medication intake and alert patients to potential risks in real-time.

## Set Clear Objectives:
Develop a GenAI Solution: Create a Generative AI-driven tool that serves as a personalized health monitor for patients.
Track Medication Intake: The tool will keep a comprehensive record of a patient's medication regimen, including both prescribed and supplementary medicines.

## Generate Warnings for Drug Interactions: 
Automatically identify and warn patients about potential harmful interactions between drugs they are currently taking.

## Side-Effect Mitigation Recommendations: 
In cases where there's a risk of side effects, the tool will offer actionable advice and recommended steps to mitigate these side effects.

# Technical Requirements:

## Generative AI Technology:
Utilize OpenAI API for advanced AI-driven analytics and predictions.
Implement Hugging Face for model training and deployment capabilities.
Conduct Data Cleaning to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.
Engage in Frontend Development using Figma for UI/UX design and incorporate black-box AI solutions for intuitive user interfaces.
Use Next.js for efficient, server-rendered React applications on the web.
Leverage Backend Development Tools with the Intel Developer Cloud for scalable computing power.
Utilize Intel Cloud services for additional computational and storage needs.

# User Requirements:

## Target Users:
Patients needing assistance in managing their medication intake and understanding potential side effects.
Healthcare Providers (doctors, pharmacists) seeking tools to offer better patient care and medication advice.
Personal Caretakers and Nurses who assist patients with their daily healthcare routines.
General Public with minimal technical background, needing an easy-to-use solution for managing health and medication.

# Data Requirements:

## Data Access and Storage:
Secure permission to use the MIMIC-3 dataset for a comprehensive medical records foundation.
MongoDB will serve as the database for storing application data, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
Implement strict privacy protection measures to safeguard individual patient data, adhering to regulations and ethical standards.

# Summary of Stakeholder Engagement Insights:

## Need for Simplicity: 
A strong demand for an application that simplifies medication management without the use of technical medical jargon.
Lack of Centralized Monitoring: Patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals face challenges in tracking medication intake and understanding the implications of drug interactions due to the absence of a centralized, accessible tool.
Knowledge Gap in Medication Interaction: Nurses and personal healthcare providers often lack the specialized knowledge required to identify and manage the risks associated with medication interactions.
Mitigation Measures Unknown: There's a significant gap in awareness and understanding of how to address or mitigate the side effects should they arise.
In response to these findings, the project team decided to proceed with the development of an accessible, accurate application designed to ease the burden on patients and healthcare providers by offering a comprehensive solution for medication management and interaction warnings. This initiative aims to fill the identified need for a tool that enhances the safety and efficacy of medication use in a patient-centric manner.


# Must-have Features Summary:

## User-Friendly Application: 
Develop an easy-to-navigate, intuitive interface suitable for non-technical users, emphasizing human-centric design principles.
Patient Information Input: Incorporate a feature for entering patient details (e.g., name, age, sex, height) and medication information either through text input or photo uploads.

## Medication Analysis: 
Implement AI-driven analysis to understand medications and their potential side effects, with attention to varying impacts across different age groups.
Side-Effect Identification: Automatically identify and display possible side effects for the medications entered by the user.

## Medication Benefits Overview: Provide users with information on the benefits of their prescribed medications.
Supplementary Medication Advice: Offer recommendations on the intake or discontinuation of supplementary health medications based on potential reactions in the body.

# Nice-to-have Features Summary:

## Medication Auto-Complete: 
Enhance the medication input process with an auto-complete feature that suggests medicine names to users as they type.

## Health Practices Suggestions: 
Generate standard health practice recommendations based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes.

## Diet and Allergen Warnings: 
Provide tailored advice on foods, allergens, and practices to avoid, derived from diagnostic codes.

#### This feature prioritization establishes a clear roadmap for developing an application that not only addresses the immediate needs of managing medication intake and understanding potential interactions and side effects but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements that could offer additional value to users through more personalized and comprehensive health management tools.
